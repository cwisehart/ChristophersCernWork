# ChristophersCernWork
repository for all the good stuff I make while learning programming for use at CERN.

I worked on version control and general TEX editing this week given I uploaded some rtf files last week. I'm not advanced enough
to complete the problem set but I hope to work on it as I get more comfortable with layout and control.

Sorry for not being totally on top of this class Dr Meehan, I feel I should explain im working on a presidential campaign
(you can probably guess as to which a millenial from Cali is for) as well as my own local election which is occupying a lot of work
as crunch time approaches. I'll definitely try to be more on top of learning though.
